## TODO:
* Consider allowing providers to select a number of their products, in order to show them for a quick peek when deciding where to order? We would need to add something to the database for this
* Consider adding tutorials/explanations for when a client/provider first uses a certain function? Eg. when first ordering, creating a product, etc.. a modal is shown that explains everything
* Explore LESS? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1065435/can-a-css-class-inherit-one-or-more-other-classes
# DONE:
* Make footers stay at the bottom of the pages

# To dump a database
* Navigate to your Xampp directory.
* Go to mysql\bin
* Run the following command: `mysqldump -u root -p uni_web_prod > filename.sql`
* Password is (should be) blank
